<span style="color:#B8B8F3">

- Limits underlie various branches of calculus.
- Essential for defining tangents and velocities, central to differential calculus.

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#D7B8F3">Introduction to Tangents and Rates of Change</span>

<span style="color:#D7B8F3">
In the 1600s, Newton and Leibniz independently created new mathematical language to talk about tangent lines and rates of change.

<span style="color:#F397D6">

1. Given a graph of a function, how do we find its tangent lines?
2. How do we describe the instantaneous velocity of an object in motion?

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#A03E99">The Tangent Problem</span>

<span style="color:#A03E99">

- **Definition**: A tangent to a curve touches the curve at a single point and has the same direection as the curve at that point.
- **Example 1**: Finding the tangent line to the parabola $ y = x^2 $ at point $ (1,1) $.
  - The slope of the tangent line can be approximated by the slopes of the secant lines approaching the point.
  - Calculation:
    - Select a point $ Q(x, x^2) $ near $ P(1,1) $.
    - Compute the slope of secant lines $ m\_{PQ} $ as $ Q $ approaches $ P $
    - As $ x $ gets closer to 1, the slope $m_{PQ}$ approaches 2.
  - **Conclusion**: The slope of the tangent line at $ P(1, 1) $ is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines, which is 2.
  - **Equation**: Using the point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line at $P(1, 1)$ is $y = 2x-1$.

#### **Answer: Find Secant Lines**

To find the tangent line, we start by finding the secant lines that go through $(a, f(a))$ and $(a+h, f(a+h))$ for small values of $h$. As $h$ gets "infinitesimally" small, the secant line approaches the tangent line.

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#B8B8F3"> The Slope of the Secant Line</span>

<span style="color:#B8B8F3">

- The slope of the secant line through $(a, f(a))$ and $(a+h, f(a+h))$ is given by:
  $$
  \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
  $$
    </span>

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#D7B8F3">Newton and Leibniz's Contribution</span>

<span style="color:#D7B8F3">

Newton and Leibniz developed language to express what happens to the slope of the secant line as $h$ gets "infinitesimally" close to 0:

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#F397D6">The Velocity Problem</span>

<span style="color:#F397D6">

- **Definition**: Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at a specific moment.
- **Example 3**: Finding the velocity of a ball dropped from the CN Tower after 5 seconds.
  - Using Galilleo's law $s(t)=4.9t^2$
  - Calculate average velocities over shorter time intervals around $ t = 5 $:
    - $ \text{Average velocity} = \frac{s(5.1) - s(5)}{5.1 - 5} = 49.49 \, \text{m/s} $.
    - As the interval shortens, the average velocity approaches 49 m/s.
  - **Conclusion**: The instantaneous velocity at $ t = 5 $ seconds is the limit of these average velocities, which is 49 m/s.
    </span>

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#A03E99">Calculating Velocity</span>

<span style="color:#A03E99">
To find out how fast an object is moving, we:

1. Measure the distance it travels.
2. Divide by the amount of time it takes.

If $\Delta x$ is the change in location, and $\Delta t$ is the change in time, then $ \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} $ is the average velocity.

We then let $\Delta t$ get "infinitesimally" small and see what happens to $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$:

$$
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

### <span style="color:black; background-color:#B8B8F3"> Example: Dropping an Apple</span>

<span style="color:#B8B8F3">
We are given the position function of an apple dropped from a height, described by the equation:

$$ x(t) = 4.9t^2 $$

#### **Average Velocity on a Time Interval**

To compute the average velocity on the time interval from $ t = 1 $ to $ t = 2 $:

$$
x(1) = 4.
